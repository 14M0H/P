        <p> Dear my love,  
          <p>
          i was thinking, maybe you'd want to go out with me it would involve cuddling, 
          indecisive decisions since were clearly incapable of making decisions, watching rom-coms na like mo. Not exact 14 medyo busy sched natin 
          but I promise to make it a day filled with fun, laughter, and maybe just a little bit of romance.
